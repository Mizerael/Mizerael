# Hi, I'm Mizerael!

Welcome to my little playground on GitHub. Here you’ll find a mix of code experiments, course projects, and a few attempts at making my workflow just a bit more magical.

---

## My Toolbox

• Python  
Automating tasks, tackling mathematical problems, and more  
(see: [cv_ssu](https://github.com/Mizerael/cv_ssu), [isat](https://github.com/Mizerael/isat))

• Typst  
Typesetting magic and document wizardry  
(see: [p-adic_ssu](https://github.com/Mizerael/p-adic_ssu))

• Go  
Speedy programs and robust course projects  
(see: [ssmt_ssu](https://github.com/Mizerael/ssmt_ssu))

• Shell & Automation  
Dotfiles, scripts, and a highly customized environment  
(see: [dotfiles](https://github.com/Mizerael/dotfiles))

• Lua  
Neovim configuration and workflow customization  
(see: [dotfiles](https://github.com/Mizerael/dotfiles))

• CSS  
Styling and making things look just right  
(see: [dotfiles](https://github.com/Mizerael/dotfiles))

Always experimenting, always learning—my repo list is my playground.

## Education

I'm currently a master's student at the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technologies, Saratov State University (SSU).  
And yes, I'm a little bit lazy.

## About Me

I’m always up for a new challenge—whether that’s learning a language, customizing my editor, or automating something that should have been automated yesterday.
